<h1>Important concepts</h1>
<p>There are a few important concepts in eZ Exceed you need to grasp in order to use it, implement for it and customise it.</p>
<h2><a id="important-concepts-core-principles" href="#important-concepts-core-principles"></a> Our core principles are</h2>
<ul>
<li>Touch first</li>
<li>Stay in context</li>
<li>Forward-leaning</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="important-concepts-the stack" href="#important-concepts-the-stack"></a> The Stack</h2>
<p>The main interaction pattern in eZ Exceed is the stack:</p>
<p><img src="assets/img/01-stack.png" alt="The Stack"></p>
<p>The stack allows editors to work with layered content without leaving the initial context.
As the example screenshot shows the stack has a context path with <code>Sitemap -&gt; Object edit -&gt; Add location</code> and
it makes it easy to see this <em>breadcrumb</em> as well as jump in it.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of the stack is that everything you try to do in eZ Exceed simply opens a new level
in the stack, meaning you never leave the page and have to juggle multiple tabs to keep sane.</p>
<p>When an editor clicks an action inside eZ Exceed it <strong>pushes</strong> a stack level with some UI, and when the editor is done using that stack level
a context is passed back to the overarching stack level — the initiator — with enough data to store the users interaction.
For example clicking <em>Add location</em> pushes a <em>Sitemap</em> UI and it returns one, or several <code>locationId</code>s.</p>
