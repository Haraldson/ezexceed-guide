Permissions and policies
========================

User of eZ Exceed does not require any special permissions over what eZ Publish
would normally require. For a normal editor you should assign the following permissions:

* content
  * create
  * edit
  * manage_locations

* ezoe
  * edit

This should be sufficient for normal every day usage.
For `content -> create / edit` you should specify a specific **subtree**
as well as a class list limitation for the best possible experience.
